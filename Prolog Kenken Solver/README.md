Kenken is a popular puzzle game. It is described on [Wikipedia]()

>As in Sudoku, the goal of each puzzle is to fill a grid with digits –– 1 through 4 for a 4×4 grid, 1 through 5 for a 5×5, 1 through 6 for a 6×6, etc. 
>–– so that no digit appears more than once in any row or any column (a Latin square). Grids range in size from 3×3 to 9×9. 
>Additionally, KenKen grids are divided into heavily outlined groups of cells –– often called “cages” –– and the numbers in the cells of each cage must 
>produce a certain “target” number when combined using a specified mathematical operation (one of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division). 
>For example, a linear three-cell cage specifying addition and a target number of 6 in a 4×4 puzzle must be satisfied with the digits 1, 2, and 3. 
>Digits may be repeated within a cage, as long as they are not in the same row or column. No operation is relevant for a single-cell cage: placing the 
>"target" in the cell is the only possibility (thus being a "free space"). The target number and operation appear in the upper left-hand corner of the 
>cage.

This program uses Prolog, a logical programming language, to solve any Kenken puzzle of a reasonable size.
In particular, it uses finite domain constraint satisfaction.
